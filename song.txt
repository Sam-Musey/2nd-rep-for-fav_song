I can feel the fire
Raining down its weight upon my days
I feel its solace washing over me in waves
This is a fight
A wake to idle sight
I found my way inside its ever-guiding light

Some will say
Completion lives inside of me
I avow
I gave with all my heart is allowed
Avow

Devotion frees the few
Devotion draws away the dead of night
Devotion waits for you
Heals a hollow mind

Hail, hail, hail
Hail Devotion
Hail, hail, hail
Hail Devotion

I will rise before my shadow here
Is cast upon its grave
I will inherit every scar before I cave
This is my cause
A plea to end the dark
To be a witness to redemption 'til we part
